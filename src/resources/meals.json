Stir until smooth.\", \n\"Put the potato cubes in a large mixing bowl and add the chopped egg whites, the yolk mixture and all other ingredients except for the paprika, saving the mayonnaise as the final addition. While adding the mayonnaise in last, stir carefully and slowly until the salad is well blended. Too much mayonnaise can make the potato salad runny -- if you don't need all the mayonnaise, then stop when you have a good blend.",

Cover with cling wrap and refrigerate for at least four hours prior to serving.\", \n\"NOTE: I do prefer to use Heinz mustard but any regular yellow mustard will do.

Put a little container of flaky sea salt like Maldon on the table, with breads and wine.\", \n\"*COOK'S NOTE: I made Vinaigrette no 1 with 2 tablespoons maple syrup, but suggested less syrup here for the average taste. If your maple syrup is the real thing and quite thin, you might want to use my original 2 tablespoons. It is SUPPOSED to be slightly sweet, to contrast with the relative sharpness of the basil one. Use your judgment. It's also an amazing discovery: it does not separate at all, and would be absolutely great with cold roast pork as well."

Make sure to chop the dried fruit into bite-sized pieces.  When dividing the water between the bowls, add 5-oz boiling water to the adult portion and 3-oz to the child portion (using a measuring cup makes this easy).  Skip the nuts if your child hasn\u2019t been introduced to them yet or if the pieces are large enough to present a choking hazard.  Also, make sure your child has gotten an OK from the doctor to eat honey (typically given at 1 year)."

While soaking it's important to change the water every 12 hours or so. It is then ready to be eaten as is. Simply drain and add to your dishes, or eat it raw - I love it with some fresh garlic, sea salt, and a dash of lime juice! mmmm Wild rice that has not been cooked has so much  texture and flavor and nutrition - it is simply amazing! For leftovers, strain, and place in fridge in a sealed container - keeps for about a week."

Strain through wire strainer, stirring with a spoon from the bottom to get all the thick parts through. Keep in fridge until cold and serve cold. Or can be served warm, up to you! Just an FYI, Santa Cruz Organics sells apricot nectar and it runs between $3-4 for a bottle unless it's on sale. For apple cider, get a good cloudy variety that stores usually sell in their produce or refrigerated section. Don't just use apple juice. I used fresh pumpkin that I had roasted the night before, but I'm sure you could use canned as well. May even taste more 'pumpkin-y'. Makes at least 12 good sized servings, probably more."

      "I always try to make my chicken stock from scratch (time permitting), adding a bit of rosemary, a tiny pinch of saffron and a bit of thyme. If you're going to use bouillon, I'd recommend at least heating it up with these herbs and then straining before you start.\", \n\"Keep your stock hot but not boiling as you cook.",
      "Coat the bottom of your pallera/pan with olive oil.",
      "Brown your chorizo over high heat for 1-2 minutes. Do not fully cook, just get the outside well browned. Set aside. This should add a nice red color and a hell of a flavor to your oil.",
      "Brown the Rabbit for 2-3 minutes. It should not be fully cooked. Set aside.",
      "Brown garlic, onion and bell pepper until they're softened, adding plum tomatoes shortly before the mixture is finished.",
      "Push the vegetables to one side of the pan and on the other add the half can of tomato paste. Caramelize it, flipping it and spreading it until it begins to loosen (1-2 min over hight heat).\", \n\"Mix all of the vegetables and meats together with the caramelized tomato paste also adding the paprika, parsley and thyme.",
      "Add rice, mixing together and stirring as the rice browns (1-1 1/2) minutes. As the rice browns mix in the saffron. Make sure to break it between your fingers and stir it in to release all those tasty oils.",
      "When the rice is slightly translucent add enough chicken stock to cover the whole mixture. If it's been kept warm, it will begin to boil almost immediately. Lower to a medium heat but keep it at a steady boil.\", \n\"This is where paella is made and broken. I stir a few times in the first 5-10 minutes, adding broth as necessary to keep the rice fully covered. After this you must let the paella SIT! Let it cook another 10-20 minutes (I find that this step takes longer on a stovetop), adding broth bit by bit to keep the rice submerged until the rice on the top is al dente. Don't worry about rice burning to the bottom, this part (which actually has a name which escapes me at the moment, it's something like socarrat) is a tasty delicacy.\", \n\"Once you've stirred the paella for the last time and are letting cook, when you have about 8 minutes left to cook lay shrimp on top, turning over after 2-4 minutes to cook other side.",
      "When the rice on top is still quite al dente, take paella off of heat and cover. You must let it sit for 15-20 minutes. I've taken the lid off prematurely and ended up with a crunchy mess. Patience is the key.",
      "Once you're sure it's ready uncover, garnish with lemon wedges and enjoy!"

So I will skip that.  So  --  that aside  --   Salsa  --  after chopping all the fruit and vegetables, mix the mango, avocado, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, red pepper, oil, garlic, seasoning, lime juice, and just  set to the side covered well with plastic wrap.",
      "Avocado Creme  --  just a dash of salt if needed, I don't add more than just a pinch, sour cream and avocado.  I just mash wish a fork.  Honestly guys and gals  --  just add to a baggie and squeeze.  Save the bowl and fork.  Why not.  I like to add it to a small bowl when I serve it but for a quick make  --  it works just fine.\", \n\"Take a couple of cups of the cabbage  --  right out of the bag.  Just hit it with salt and pepper.  Nothing more. Like a pinch.  It just reduces the juice.  Put in a serving bowl and set to the side.  Cover with plastic wrap.  Nothing more.",
      "The garnish  --  open can, drain and put in bowl  --  I think we can all handle that. I will never be offended if someone doesn't like them.  Black olives to me just work well with mango and avocado and fish, so.  I like them as a topping.",
      "Now  --  the salsa is made and all the flavors are mixing together.  The avocado cream is chilling, And now the fish  -- We are all done.  Five (5) minutes and taco time.\", \n\"Fish  --  in a large baggie mix the salt, pepper and flour.  Then just lightly toss fish fish to coat lightly.  Now in a large frying pan non stick I prefer for this, add the oil and heat to medium heat.  Just pan saute the fish until lightly brown on each side.  It only takes 2 or so minutes per side.  Once done  --  just remove the fish and drain on a paper towel.",
      "Beans  --  just heat up in a measuring cup in the microwave.  Nothing more for this  --  ok some time a squirt some lime in it if if had some left.  not a big deal.  Enough big flavors for this dish.\", \n\"Tortillas  --   I wrap my tortillas in foil and just warm up in the oven as I cook the fish.  They just take 10 minutes. is all.  Nothing much.  They can also be heated up on a grill too.",
      "Dinner  --  Just serve all the ingredients so everyone can put them together them selves.  Taco Bar Style.  A bowl of the fresh fish, just broken up, the cabbage, beans, the sauce, olives and the salsa.  Now, if you want to add some salsa, tomato based you can.  To me NO WAY.",
      "Ok - Tortilla warm, then  --  Cabbage chilled, then  -- Warm beans, then  -- Fish warm, then  -- Sauce chilled, then  -- Salsa chilled, -- Now  --  everyone has the best fish taco around trust me.  I have a taco party every year.  I make this and also make the traditional and then a chicken one.  This is by far the requested one.\", \n\"If you want cheese, I prefer a provolone or monterey jack, bland, but I don't for this dish.",
      "That taco bar is worthy or any party.  If I add the beans to the dish I don't add as a side.  but a nice green salad and some rice is such a easy thing to add.  This is one of my OH SO INEXPENSIVE MEALS.  with summer prices for fruit and Tilapia so cheap.  This  easily feeds 6-8 and is worth entertaining with.",

      "SERVE.",
      "note:",
      "This doubles, triples etc really well, but if making several servings at once you'll probably need to clean the knife after doing a couple as it gets really sticky!",
      "Please use Oat Bran - not oatmeal or quick oats, it's just the bran part.  Oat bran is naturally really sweet and creamy and takes this from out of the ordinary to the realms of a high luxury yoghurt.  At a push I guess quick oats would do, but I've tried it and it comes a poor second.\", \n\"Oat bran is brilliant for lowering cholesterol, is just so unbelievably good for you and what's cool about it is that it actually even tastes really nice!  Well worth trying a packet and adding a bit to 'this and that'! :)  It goes great in bread making!"

Since the potatoes are warm your sauce may appear to be a little runny. Fear not- Kitchen Warrior! They will thicken back up after cooling a bit. But pouring the mixture over WARM potatoes allows the sauce to be absorbed by the potatoes resulting in a much better flavor that usually only occurs the second day. And we all know that potato salad is better the second day, don't we Dears?.\", \n\"At this point,coarsely chop the egg into the bowl. Leave really big chunks. I usually just hold it in my hand over the bowl. Halve it with a butter knife lengthwise, then cut it into fourths crosswise.",
      "Gently fold the eggs in the salad and then turn into a covered 8x8 casserole. It just barely fits.",

Don't try to do it when it is warm- let the flavors blend before doing anything else.\", \n\"Edith takes these to church potlucks and she says that no matter how many potato salads there are this one goes first. I make these for Dugan's monthly poker party and riots ensue if this dish isn't chilled and ready upon their arrival.",

      "Preheat your oven to 450\u00b0F.",
      "In a medium bowl add the Bisquick and milk. Mix together with a fork until dry mix is fully incorporated and forms a ball.",
      "Divide the large ball of dough into 6 equally sized balls.",
      "Take one ball and flatten it between your palms to form a circle about a 1/4 inch thick. Repeat for the other 5 balls, and set aside.",
      "In a small skillet mix eggs, milk, salt, pepper and scallions over medium heat. Stir constantly until eggs no longer look \\\"wet\\\". Remove from heat.\", \n\"Take one of the circles of dough and put 1 Tablespoon of shredded cheddar cheese on top in the middle. Place 1/4 cup of the scrambled eggs on top of the cheese then place one of the strips of bacon on top of that. (You can cut it into thirds or even chop it if you like.).",
      "Take a second circle of dough and place it on top of the mound of cheese, eggs and bacon. Bring the edge of the top one down so it touches the bottom and pinch the two together around the edges.",
      "Place the pockets on a lightly greased cookie sheet and bake for 7-10 minutes or until golden brown on top.\", \n\"Want to make ahead and freeze? Just pop in a container or plastic baggie and throw them in the freezer after they've cooled. To heat, wrap loosely in a paper towel and microwave on high for 2 minutes 45 seconds.",
      "NOTE: The great thing about this recipe is that you can change it up pretty much any way you want. If you don't have Bisquick you can use pretty much any country biscuit recipe. Change up the meat if you like: ham, sausage, bacon, cheddar sausage, whatever you like. Add more cheese if you like. Use Egg Substitute for a more healthy version. I have tried it several different ways and it lends itself to changes well.Also the crust is a thinner crust. If you would like a thicker crust then simply double the biscuit ingredients, follow the directions to mix it up and divide into 6 equal balls, but make the circles of dough between 1/4 inch and 1/2 thick. It will require extra baking time. Bake about 15 - 20 minutes of until golden brown on top."

If you choose not to use the diced tomatos, you are ready to eat. If you choose to use the tomatoes, add them and mix them gently inches At this point, you can either put it in a casserole dish, and pour two beaten eggs over it, then top it with a layer of spaghetti sauce and bake it until the eggs are done and its hot and bubbly OR you can just eat it the way it is sprinkled with salt and pepper. Either way, I think ist yummy. It is even better the next day heated up in the microwave. But, I warn you, if you don't like Spam, you won't like this!"

After dicing your onion, be sure and rinse it in cold running water to remove any bitterness. I never measure out the mayonnaise, just add enough until I am satisfied. The cookbook recommends using Best Foods or Hellman's mayonnaise. I often add 2-3 Tablespoons of milk right before serving to make sure that the pasta is moist enough. The original recipe adds one small can of oil based tuna (drained), but I haven't seen it added to the salad when I have ordered it. Some reviewers are commenting that the recipe is too salty and that the salt should be reduced, so please keep that in mind. I think that I just add to taste, but the 2 teaspoons is what is in the original recipe in the cookbook.].\", \n\"UPDATE May 2014: I checked with my local L&L Hawaiian BBQ and they do NOT put tuna in their macaroni salad, it is totally vegetarian."
